Geo/TAF version 1.01
====================

Geo::TAF decodes aviation METAR and TAF weather forecast code 
strings into English or, if you sub-class, some other language.

METAR (Routine Aviation weather Report) and TAF (Terminal Area
weather Report) are ascii strings containing codes describing
the weather at airports and weather bureaus around the world.

This module attempts to decode these reports into a form of 
English that is hopefully more understandable than the reports
themselves.
